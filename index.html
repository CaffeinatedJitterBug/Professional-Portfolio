                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I'm a UNH web development boot camp alumni that has taken various programming and computer classes on top of the boot camp. During the boot camp, I learned about various aspects of fullstack web development, such as HTML/CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, Node.js, databases such as MySQL, NoSQL and MondoDB, Routing, React, and Handlebars. I also have taken classes on computer hardware, Linux, and Raspbery Pi. I have been interested in computers since I was a kid and took an interest in coding when I was a teenager. I'm hoping to find work that will allow me to utilize the skills I have learn and provide me with challenges to drive me to improve upon my already existing skills.</p>
